## About Us

The Monash Association of Coding (MAC) bridges the gap between classroom and industry by providing technical skills and hands-on experience to students. We believe in making coding accessible and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.

## Tech Stack

Our projects team develops software that benefit the broader IT community. We also run technical workshops to help students gain practical skills in modern technologies and development practices. We try to stay up to date by using modern, production-grade technologies and development workflows.

We work with:
- Java
- Kotlin
- TypeScript
- GoLang

## Infrastructure

As a non-profit organization, we deploy and maintain our infrastructure on Microsoft Azure through their [educational grant program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/azure).
